# ISU Laboratory Spaces and Equipment
In this section, we will introduce you to the laboratory spaces and equipment used by Dr. McNulty's group at Idaho State University (ISU). Each lab space contains specific equipment and tools that the group uses to conduct experiments, analyze data, and develop new technologies.

## Main Lab Space
The main lab space is where the majority of the group's experimental work takes place. Some of the key equipment found in this space includes:

### Cosmic Ray Stand
The cosmic ray stand consists of three gas electron multiplier (GEM) detectors that track incoming cosmic rays. These detectors are used in conjunction with scintillating paddles, which serve as a trigger for the data acquisition system (DAQ).

### DAQs (Data Acquisition Systems)
There are three DAQs in the main lab space, namely DAQ 3, 4, and 5. These systems are connected to either a NIM bin system or a VME crate and are responsible for collecting and processing data from the detectors. The DAQs run the CODA software developed by Jefferson Lab.

### VME Crate and NIM Bins
VME crates and NIM bins are modular electronics systems used to house and power various electronic modules and components. VME crates use the Versa Module Eurocard (VME) bus standard, while NIM bins use the Nuclear Instrumentation Module (NIM) standard. Both systems allow for easy integration and customization of the experimental setup.

### PMT Shutter Wheel System
The PMT shutter wheel system is an in-house designed apparatus that measures the non-linearity of photomultiplier tube (PMT) gain. This system helps the group to better understand and characterize the performance of PMTs used in various experiments.

## Second Lab Space
The second lab space contains specialized equipment and tools for computer-aided design (CAD) and optical measurements.

### CAD Computer
This lab space houses the computer used for most CAD design work. The group utilizes CAD software to design and model experimental components, detector systems, and other custom parts needed for their research.

### Optical Table
The optical table is a large, stable platform designed to minimize vibrations and provide a precise working surface for optical experiments and measurements.

### Light Transmission Apparatus
The light transmission apparatus is used to measure the light transmission losses of irradiated quartz samples. This helps the group to characterize the properties of these materials and assess their suitability for use in experiments and detector systems.

## Third Lab Space
The third lab space is dedicated to 3D printing and rapid prototyping.

### 3D Printers
The lab contains two 3D printers, the Ultimaker S5 and the Ultimaker S2+. These printers are used by the group to create custom components, prototypes, and experimental setups. The Ultimaker S5 is a larger, more advanced printer with a range of material capabilities, while the Ultimaker S2+ is a smaller, more compact printer suitable for quick and smaller-scale projects.
With the help of these 3D printers, the group can quickly iterate on designs, test new ideas, and produce custom parts needed for their research. This capability greatly enhances the flexibility and efficiency of their experimental work.

In summary, the various laboratory spaces and equipment at ISU enable the group to conduct a wide range of experimental work, from detector development and data acquisition to optical measurements and rapid prototyping. By utilizing these resources, the group can further their research goals and contribute to the advancement of
