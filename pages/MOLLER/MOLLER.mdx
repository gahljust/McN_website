# MOLLER - Measurment of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction 

MOLLER is an experiment that will run at the [Jefferson National Laboratory](https://www.jlab.org/). Its purpose is to measure the parity-violating 
asymmetry of the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction. 

This page will briefly overview the concepts needed to understand the experiment's basic principles. The topics highlighted in the 
videos and text below are the following:
{/* MAke an unorderd list */}

* Lepton-lepton Electroweak reaction
* Parity
* Parity Violating Asymmetry
* Cherenkov Radiation
* Cherenkov Detectors
* MOLLER design


## What is the Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction?

The video below describes the Lepton-Lepton Electroweak reaction.

<div align = "center">
  <Yvideo video={{src: 'Nlp-PWTs1NY', title: 'MOLLER: Part 1'}} />
</div>

So you can see that the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction is a reaction between two leptons. In MOLLER it will be two electrons.
When these electrons interact, there could be an **electromagnetic** interaction \(where they exchange a photon\) or a **weak** interaction \(where they exchange a Z^0 boson\). 
The mixing of these interactions is why it is called the electroweak reaction. 

Its actually not quite that simple but if your interested in learning more about the electroweak theory, 
you can start by reading here [Electroweak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction). And an excelent introductory book 
is [Introduction to elementary particle physics](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018) By David Griffiths.

Ok, so know we know what is meant by "Lepton-lepton" and "Electroweak".
But MOLLER will be a measurment of the **Parity Violating Asymmetry** in the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction.So, what is parity? and what 
is parity violation?

The video below describes these concepts.


## First part: Theoretical background

### 1.1.1. The Standard Model
The Standard model is a theory that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. It is a theory of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions. The Standard Model is based on the following assumptions:

{/* Make a bulleted list */}
* Assumption 1: The fundamental particles are point-like and have no internal structure.
* Assumption 2: The fundamental particles are described by quantum field theories.
* Assumption 3: The fundamental particles interact with each other via the exchange of virtual particles.
* Assumption 4: The fundamental particles are described by relativistic quantum field theories.
