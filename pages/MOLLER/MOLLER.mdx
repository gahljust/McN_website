<small style={{ fontSize: "0.8em", color: "gray" }}>

</small>

MOLLER is an experiment that will run at the [Jefferson National Laboratory](https://www.jlab.org/). Its purpose is to measure the parity-violating 
asymmetry of the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction. 

This page will briefly overview the concepts needed to understand the experiment's basic principles. The topics highlighted in the 
videos and text below are the following:
{/* Make an unorderd list */}

* Lepton-lepton Electroweak reaction
* Parity
* Parity Violating Asymmetry
* Cherenkov Radiation
* Cherenkov Detectors
* MOLLER design


## What is the Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction?

The video below describes the Lepton-Lepton Electroweak reaction.

So you can see that the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction is a reaction between two leptons. In MOLLER it will be two electrons.
When these electrons interact, there could be an **electromagnetic** interaction \(where they exchange a photon\) or a **weak**
interaction \(where they exchange a Z^0 boson\). The mixing of these interactions is why it is called the **electroweak** reaction. 
And MOLLER's measurment of the parity-violating asymmetry will allow us to derive a quantity called the **weak mixing angle**.

Its actually not quite that simple. If your interested in learning more about electroweak theory, 
you can start by reading here [Electroweak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction). And 
an excelent introductory book is [Introduction to elementary particle physics](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018) 
By David Griffiths.

Ok, so know we know what is meant by "Lepton-lepton" and "Electroweak".
But MOLLER will be a measurment of the **Parity Violating Asymmetry** in the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction. So, what is parity? 
and what is parity violation?

Parity is a concept in physics that refers to the **spatial inversion** of a physical system. This means system remains the same when 
its spatial coordinates are inverted. Then we say that the system has **parity symmetry**. However, the weak force violates this symmetry, 
which means that some processes involving the weak force do not look the same when their spatial coordinates are inverted.

This video below describes the concept of parity and parity violation.

So, in the context of the MOLLER experiment, the parity-violating asymmetry refers to the difference in scattering probabilities of 
the electrons when their spins are flipped. By measuring this asymmetry, the experiment will gain insight into the weak mixing 
angle, a crucial parameter in the electroweak theory.

This brings us to the question of how do we actually measure the parity-violating asymmetry in the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction? 
We can do this by using Cherenkov radiation.

### Cherenkov Radiation

Cherenkov radiation happens when a charged particle, like an electron, zips through a medium faster than light can travel in that 
same medium. As a result, the particle gives off a cone-shaped burst of electromagnetic radiation, which we call Cherenkov radiation. 
It's like a sonic boom, but for light.

### Cherenkov detectors
Alright, so that's what Cherenkov radiation is. But what does this have to do with the MOLLER experiment? Well, MOLLER 
uses detectors that are sensitive to Cherenkov radiation. When electrons from MOLLER's electron beam scatter and travel through the 
Cherenkov detectors and they emit Cherenkov radiation. By analyzing the patterns of Cherenkov radiation intensity we can derive 
the value of the weak mixing angle.

To do this, MOLLER uses special Cherenkov detectors, called thin quartz Cherenkov detectors. Which are a special kind of detector known as 
a DIRC detector. DIRC stands for Detection of Internally Reflected Cherenkov light. These detectors are designed to pick up all or most of 
Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged particles passing through them. The radition is then captured by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), and 
recorded by the experiment's data acquisition system.

This video below gives an example of how these types Cherenkov detectors work.

<br></br>
<br></br>

  <Yvideo video={{src: 'Nlp-PWTs1NY', title: 'MOLLER: Part 4'}} />
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

The Cherenkov radiation signal read by the detectors will be slightly different depending on the direction of the electron's 
[spin](/MOLLER/MOLLER/#parity).And this is how the measurment of a lepton-lepton electroweak reaction will work.

## MOLLER Design and the ShowerMax Detector

Now that we understand all of the basic physics concepts we can look at a high level overview of the MOLLER experiment.

In the MOLLER experiment, several components work together. First, there's the **11 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam**

<br></br>
<br></br>

<div align = "center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ padding: "20px 20px" }}>
        ![](/images/sBoom_jet.png)

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center", maxWidth: "250px"  }}>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br></br>

Next is the 1.25 m **liquid hydrogen target**, where the beam electrons interact with target electrons, leading to scattering events. 

<br></br>
<br></br>

<div align = "center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ padding: "20px 20px" }}>
        ![](/images/sBoom_jet.png)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center", maxWidth: "250px"  }}>
       Liquid hydrogen target.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

Following the target is the **spectrometer** system, consisting of resistive **toroidal magnets** with a 7-fold azimuthal symmetry, which separates 
and focuses the scattered electrons. 

<br></br>
<br></br>

<div align = "center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ padding: "20px 20px" }}>
        ![](/images/sBoom_jet.png)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center", maxWidth: "250px"  }}>
       Liquid hydrogen target.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

The primary detectors in the system are the **thin quartz Cherenkov radiators** and photomultiplier tubes 
(PMTs), which measure the Cherenkov radiation emitted by the scattered electrons. 

<br></br>
<br></br>

<div align = "center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ padding: "20px 20px" }}>

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center", maxWidth: "250px"  }}>
       The primary thin quartz detectors.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

Finally we have additional detectors including **ShowerMax** (sampling calorimeters), **pion detectors** (acrylic calorimeters), and large and 
small angle monitors, which help monitor backgrounds and calibrations. Together, these components form a comprehensive experimental 
setup that allows scientists to measure the parity-violating asymmetry in the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction.

So, imagine you're an electron zipping through the MOLLER experiment. You and your fellow electrons are part of an 11 GeV 
longitudinally polarized beam, and you're about to interact with a 1.25 m liquid hydrogen target. As you approach the target, 
you can feel the electromagnetic and weak forces at play, exchanging photons and Z^0 bosons with other electrons you encounter.

As you continue your journey through the experiment, you'll pass through a series of resistive toroidal magnets, which help 
separate and focus you and your scattered peers. This setup is pretty clever because it has a 7-fold azimuthal symmetry, so 
it's designed to catch electrons scattered at both forward and backward angles.

Once you've whizzed past the magnets, you'll enter a region filled with special detectors, like thin quartz Cherenkov radiators. 
You'll emit Cherenkov radiation as you pass through these detectors, and we will use this information to study the electroweak 
interaction and the parity-violating asymmetry.

You might also run into other auxiliary detectors along the way, such as shower-max detectors (sampling calorimeters), pion 
detectors (acrylic calorimeters), and large and small angle monitors. These devices help the researchers keep track of backgrounds 
and calibrations while they analyze the data.

In a nutshell, your adventure through the MOLLER experiment will provide scientists with crucial insights into the underlying 
physics of electron-electron interactions and the electroweak theory. And who knows, you might even help them discover new physics 
beyond the Standard Model!


That concludes the overveiw of the MOLLER experiment. In the next post we will look at the ShowerMax detector in more detail.
