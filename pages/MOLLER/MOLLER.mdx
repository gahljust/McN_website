<small style={{ fontSize: "0.8em", color: "gray" }}>

MOLLER is a cutting-edge experiment designed to study the electroweak interaction of particles, specifically electrons.
MOLLER will run at the [Jefferson National Laboratory](https://www.jlab.org/). Its purpose is to measure the parity-violating 
asymmetry of the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction. 

This page will briefly overview the concepts needed to understand the experiment's basic principles. The topics highlighted in the 
videos and text below are the following:

* Parity
* Parity Violating Asymmetry

## What is the Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction?

The video below describes the Lepton-Lepton Electroweak reaction.

So you can see that the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction is a reaction between two leptons. In MOLLER it will be two electrons.
When these electrons interact, there could be an **electromagnetic** interaction \(where they exchange a photon\) or a **weak**
interaction \(where they exchange a Z^0 boson\). The mixing of these interactions is why it is called the **electroweak** reaction. 
And MOLLER's measurment of the parity-violating asymmetry will allow us to derive a quantity called the **weak mixing angle**.

Its actually not quite that simple. If your interested in learning more about electroweak theory, 
you can start by reading here [Electroweak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction). And 
an excelent introductory book is [Introduction to elementary particle physics](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Elementary-Particles-David-Griffiths/dp/3527406018) 
By David Griffiths.

Ok, so know we know what is meant by "Lepton-lepton" and "Electroweak".
But MOLLER will be a measurment of the **Parity Violating Asymmetry** in the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction. So, what is parity? 
and what is parity violation?

Parity is a concept in physics that refers to the **spatial inversion** of a physical system. This means system remains the same when 
its spatial coordinates are inverted. Then we say that the system has **parity symmetry**. However, the weak force violates this symmetry, 
which means that some processes involving the weak force do not look the same when their spatial coordinates are inverted.

The video below describes the concept of parity and parity violation.

So, in the context of the MOLLER experiment, the parity-violating asymmetry refers to the difference in scattering probabilities of 
the electrons when their spins are flipped. By measuring this asymmetry, the experiment will gain insight into the weak mixing 
angle, a crucial parameter in the electroweak theory.

This brings us to the question of how do we actually measure the parity-violating asymmetry in the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction? 
We can do this by using Cherenkov radiation.

### Cherenkov Radiation

Cherenkov radiation happens when a charged particle, like an electron, zips through a medium faster than light can travel in that 
same medium. As a result, the particle gives off a cone-shaped burst of electromagnetic radiation, which we call Cherenkov radiation. 
It's like a sonic boom, but for light.

### Cherenkov detectors
<small style={{ fontSize: "0.8em", color: "gray" }}>
  Covered in this section: Cherenkov Detectors, total internal reflection, PMTs
</small>
Alright, so that's what Cherenkov radiation is. But what does this have to do with the MOLLER experiment?

MOLLER uses detectors that are sensitive to Cherenkov radiation. When electrons from MOLLER's electron beam scatter off of target electrons 
and travel through the Cherenkov detectors and they emit Cherenkov radiation. By analyzing the patterns of Cherenkov radiation intensity 
we can derive the value of the **weak mixing angle**.

To do this, MOLLER uses Cherenkov detectors, called thin quartz detectors. These detectors are designed to pick up all or most 
of the Cherenkov radiation emitted by charged particles passing through them. They do this because of a physical feture called 
**total internal reflection**. The radition is then captured by photomultiplier tubes (**PMTs**), and recorded by the experiment's 
data acquisition system.

The video below discusses how these types of Cherenkov detectors work.

<br></br>
<br></br>


<div align = "center">
  <Yvideo video={{src: 'pfgycNLuD78', title: 'MOLLER: Part 4'}} />
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

So, now we understand that MOLLER will measure the weak mixing angle using Cherenkov detectors. The detectors will detect Cherenkov radiation
emitted by electrons. This radiation will bounce around inside of the detector until it exits a beveled end and enters a photomultiplier tube.
By switching the direction of the electron's [spin](/MOLLER/MOLLER/#parity), we can measure a small change in the intensity of the Cherenkov radiation.
This is how the measurment of a lepton-lepton electroweak reaction will work.

## MOLLER Design

Now that we understand the basic physics concepts of *how* MOLLER will measure the weak mixing angle we can look at a high level 
overview of the entire MOLLER experiment.

Key components of the experiment include a **Beam**, a **hydrogen target**, a **magnetic spectrometer** for sorting the scattered electrons,
 **Cherenkov detectors** to capture the light emitted, and additional detectors like the **Showermax** for gathering more data. This 
 section will give more detail about each of these components.

### The Beam

The beam in the MOLLER experiment is a stream of high-energy electrons generated by a particle accelerator. These electrons are 
"spun" so that they have a specific direction, or polarization. During the experiment, the spin direction is rapidly switched back and 
forth (a process called helicity reversal). This beam is aimed at a hydrogen target.

### The Target

Next is the 1.25 m **liquid hydrogen target**, where the beam electrons interact with target electrons, leading to scattering events.

<br></br>

  </table>
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

### The Spectrometer

Following the target is the **spectrometer** system, consisting of resistive **toroidal magnets** with a 7-fold azimuthal symmetry, 
which separates and focuses the scattered electrons into 7 different channels.

<br></br>
<br></br>

<div align = "center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ padding: "20px 20px" }}>

       Liquid hydrogen target.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

### The Cherenkov Detectors
After the electrons have passed through the spectrometer, they are detected by the **Cherenkov detectors**. The main detectors in the 
MOLLER experiment are made of thin quartz and arranged in a specific geometry to effectively capture Cherenkov radiation emitted by the 
scattered electrons. 

<br></br>
<br></br>

<div align = "center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ padding: "20px 20px" }}>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br></br>
<br></br>

These detectors are organized into six concentric rings, each divided into at least 21 individual segments around 
the azimuth. The rings have different radial distances to capture the various scattered electrons. The second-largest ring primarily 
captures the Moller electron signal, while the second-smallest ring mainly captures the unradiated elastic scattered signal from 
electron-proton interactions. This strategic arrangement allows us to study the Cherenkov radiation patterns and gather crucial 
information about the underlying physics in the experiment.

Finally, we have additional detectors including **ShowerMax**, **pion detectors** (acrylic calorimeters), and large and 
small angle monitors, which help monitor backgrounds and calibrations. Together, these components form a comprehensive experimental 
setup that allows scientists to measure the parity-violating asymmetry in the lepton-lepton electroweak reaction.

Dr. McNulty's group is responsible design and construction of the ShowerMax detector. This is the detector that you would most likely be 
working on if you were to join the group. The next page has much more detailed information about ShowerMax.


So, imagine you're an electron zipping through the MOLLER experiment. You and your fellow electrons are part of an 11 GeV 
longitudinally polarized beam, and you're about to interact with a 1.25 m liquid hydrogen target. As you approach the target, 
you can feel the electromagnetic and weak forces at play, exchanging photons and Z^0 bosons with other electrons you encounter.

As you continue your journey through the experiment, you'll pass through a series of resistive toroidal magnets, which help 
separate and focus you and your scattered peers. This setup is pretty clever because it has a 7-fold azimuthal symmetry, so 
it's designed to catch electrons scattered at both forward and backward angles.

Once you've whizzed past the magnets, you'll enter a region filled with special detectors, like thin quartz Cherenkov radiators. 
You'll emit Cherenkov radiation as you pass through these detectors, and we will use this information to study the electroweak 
interaction and the parity-violating asymmetry.

You might also run into other auxiliary detectors along the way, such as shower-max detectors (sampling calorimeters), pion 
detectors (acrylic calorimeters), and large and small angle monitors. These devices help the researchers keep track of backgrounds 
and calibrations while they analyze the data.

In a nutshell, your adventure through the MOLLER experiment will provide scientists with crucial insights into the underlying 
physics of electron-electron interactions and the electroweak theory. And who knows, you might even help them discover new physics 
beyond the Standard Model!


That concludes the overveiw of the MOLLER experiment. In the next post we will look at the ShowerMax detector in more detail.
