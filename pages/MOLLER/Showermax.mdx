# ShowerMax Detector
The ShowerMax detector is a type of electromagnetic calorimeter used in the [MOLLER](/MOLLER/MOLLER) experiment 
to detect and measure the energy of scattered electrons. Electromagnetic calorimeters work by measuring the energy 
of particles that interact with the detector material and produce electromagnetic showers. In the case of ShowerMax,
these showers are generated by the scattered electrons from the polarized beam and hydrogen target in MOLLER.
The ShowerMax detector is composed of an array of quartz and tungsten tiles, the quartz tiles serve as the active 
detection material. When a scattered electron enters the detector, it interacts with the atoms in the materials, 
producing a cascade of secondary particles called an electromagnetic shower. This shower generates Cherenkov radiation, 
which is detected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
The amount of Cherenkov light produced is proportional to the energy of the incident electron, allowing the ShowerMax 
detector to measure the energy of the scattered electrons accurately. This information, combined with the data from other 
detectors in the MOLLER experiment, helps researchers analyze the parity-violating asymmetry and improve our understanding 
of the weak mixing angle.

{/*Video MOLLER part 3:
Narration:
"Welcome to the third video in our series about the MOLLER experiment. In this video, we will discuss Cherenkov radiation, 
Cherenkov detectors, and provide an overview of the MOLLER experiment design, including an introduction to the ShowerMax detector."
Animation: Show an animation of Cherenkov radiation, with a charged particle emitting a cone of light as it moves through a medium.

Narration:
"Cherenkov radiation is a phenomenon that occurs when a charged particle, such as an electron, travels through a 
medium at a speed faster than the speed of light in that medium. This causes the particle to emit a cone of electromagnetic 
radiation, known as Cherenkov radiation."
Animation: Show a simple animation of a Cherenkov detector detecting the emitted light.

Narration:
"Cherenkov detectors are devices that detect this radiation and are commonly used in particle physics experiments to 
identify and measure the properties of charged particles."
Animation: Present an overview of the MOLLER experiment design, showing the electron beam, liquid hydrogen target, 
and detectors, including the ShowerMax detector.

Narration:
"In the MOLLER experiment, a highly polarized electron beam from the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF)
 at Jefferson Lab is directed onto a liquid hydrogen target, where it interacts with unpolarized atomic electrons. The 
 scattered electrons are then detected and analyzed by an array of detectors, including the ShowerMax detector."  */}
