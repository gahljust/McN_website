# MOLLER - Measurment of a Lepton-Lepton Electroweak Reaction 

## First part: Theoretical background

### 1.1.1. The Standard Model
The Standard model is a theory that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. It is a theory of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions. The Standard Model is based on the following assumptions:

{/* Make a bulleted list */}
* Assumption 1: The fundamental particles are point-like and have no internal structure.
* Assumption 2: The fundamental particles are described by quantum field theories.
* Assumption 3: The fundamental particles interact with each other via the exchange of virtual particles.
* Assumption 4: The fundamental particles are described by relativistic quantum field theories.

### 1.1.2. The Electroweak Theory
The electroweak theory is a theory that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. It is a theory of the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions. The electroweak theory is based on the following assumptions:
