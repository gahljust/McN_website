# CAD Software: Inventor, Solidworks, and Fusion 360
In this tutorial, we will introduce you to CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software, specifically Inventor, Solidworks, and Fusion 360. 
These programs are used to create 3D models of parts and assemblies for various applications, including designing experimental setups and custom components. 
No prior experience with CAD software is assumed, and this tutorial is designed to be accessible for new incoming students.

The group has previously used Solidworks to design parts for Showermax and various other components. There was a change made by the MOLLER
colaboration to use Autodesk Inventor instead of Solidworks. This tutorial will provide instructions on how to download and install Inventor, Solidworks, and Fusion 360 (for Mac users). 

## What is CAD Software?
CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design.
It is used to create precise 3D models of objects and assemblies.
Commonly used in engineering, product design, and research projects.


## Downloading and Installing Inventor, Solidworks, and Fusion 360
In this section, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to download and install Inventor, Solidworks, and Fusion 360.

### Autodesk Inventor Instalation
This is for a free student account, which will require you to verify your student eligabilty. If you are not a student, you can still download the software, but you will have to pay for it.
1. Visit the Autodesk [website](https://www.autodesk.com/support/account/education/students-educators/get-started) page for students getting started.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a student account.
3. Make sure to select Inventor as your software.


Note: Autodesk Inventor is only available for Windows. If you have a Mac, please follow the Fusion 360 instructions below.

### Solidworks Instalation
Solidworks charges for a student account, however free accounts are offered through the IT department. If you are not a student, you can still download the software, but you will have to pay for it.
1. Visit the Solidworks [website](https://www.solidworks.com/product/students) for students.
2. Select the plan you want.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the software.

Or 
1. Use available computers on camopus with Solidworks installed.

Or 

1. Contact the [COSE](https://help.cose.isu.edu/) IT department to see if you can get a Solidworks installation on your personal computer.
2. Click on the link for Software Installation Request Form.

Note: Solidworks is only available for Windows. If you have a Mac, please follow the Fusion 360 instructions below.

### Fusion 360 Instalation (for Mac users)
1. Visit the Autodesk [website](https://www.autodesk.com/support/account/education/students-educators/get-started) page for students getting started.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a student account.
3. Make sure to select Fusion 360 as your software.


Note: Fusion 360 is available for both Windows and Mac.

## Getting Started with CAD Software
Now that you have installed the CAD software, it's time to start exploring its features. In the following tutorials, we will provide step-by-step instructions for creating simple models in Inventor, Solidworks, and Fusion 360.
