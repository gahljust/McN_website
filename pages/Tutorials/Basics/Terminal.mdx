## Terminal Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the basic use of terminal commands. Follow the steps below to learn how to manage files and directories, view and edit files, and perform other useful tasks.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a terminal open and ready to use. Follow the instructions in the "Download and Installation" section of the main tutorial if you are unsure how to access the terminal on your system.

## Part 1:

In the first part of this tutorial, we will learn how to create, edit, and delete files and directories. We will also learn how to view the contents of files and change their permissions.

### 1. Create a New Directory

First, let's create a new directory called `terminal-tutorial`.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    mkdir terminal-tutorial
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh  {3} copy
    New-Item -ItemType Directory terminal-tutorial
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    mkdir terminal-tutorial
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You have now created a new directory called `terminal-tutorial`.

### 2. Change to the New Directory

Now, change the current directory to the `terminal-tutorial` directory that you just created. And print your working directory.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    cd terminal-tutorial
    pwd
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    Set-Location terminal-tutorial
    Get-Location
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    cd terminal-tutorial
    cd
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Here you can see you have moved to another directory and the path is printed.

### 3. Create an Empty File

Create an empty file named `example.txt` inside the `terminal-tutorial` directory.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    touch example.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    New-Item example.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    type nul > example.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You have now created a new file called `example.txt`.

### 4. Edit the File

Open `example.txt` in a text editor, add some content, and save the changes.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh {3} copy
    nano example.txt
    # Inside nano, use the arrow keys to navigate and type "Hello World" on the first line.
    # When you're done editing, press Ctrl + X to exit.
    # Press Y to confirm that you want to save the changes.
    # Press Enter to confirm the file name.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh {3} copy
    notepad example.txt
    # Inside Notepad, type "Hello World" on the first line.
    # When you're done editing, click "File" > "Save" to save the changes.
    # Close Notepad.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh {3} copy
    notepad example.txt
    # Inside Notepad, type "Hello World" on the first line.
    # When you're done editing, click "File" > "Save" to save the changes.
    # Close Notepad.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now you have edited the file and saved your changes. There are many editors inside and outside the terminal, and over time you will likely use many of them. But this is a simple way to start. Here is a nano [cheat sheet](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html).

### 5. Display File Contents

Now, let's display the contents of `example.txt`.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    cat example.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    Get-Content example.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh {3} copy
    type example.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will print the entire contents of the file to the terminal. If you want less output, you can use the `head` command to print the first 10 lines of the file, or the `tail` command to print the last 10 lines of the file.

### 6. Create a Backup

Make a copy of `example.txt` named `example_backup.txt`.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    cp example.txt example_backup.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    Copy-Item example.txt example_backup.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ``` sh {3} copy
    copy example.txt example_backup.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This makes a copy of the file and names it `example_backup.txt`.

### 7. Delete a File
Delete the example_backup.txt file.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
This is permanent! It does not go to the trash. Be careful!
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
rm example_backup.txt
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
Remove-Item example_backup.txt
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
del example_backup.txt
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 8. List Directory Contents
List the contents of the terminal-tutorial directory.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
ls
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
Get-ChildItem
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
dir
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

These commands will print the contents of the current directory. So, you can see all of the files and directories inside.

### 9. Edit the permissions of a file
Change the permissions of the example.txt file to be executable.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
chmod +x example.txt
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
Get-Item example.txt | Set-ItemProperty -Name IsExecutable -Value $true
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
icacls example.txt /grant *S-1-1-0:(RX)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 10. Change to the Parent Directory
Change the current directory to the parent directory of terminal-tutorial.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
cd ..
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
Set-Location ..
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
cd ..
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This command moves you up one directory.

### 11. Remove the Directory
Remove the terminal-tutorial directory and its contents.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
This is permanent! Be careful!
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
rm -r terminal-tutorial
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
Remove-Item terminal-tutorial -Recurse
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
rmdir /s /q terminal-tutorial
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>


Congratulations! You have now successfully performed basic file and directory operations using the terminal. Keep practicing these commands to become more proficient in using the terminal.

## Part 2

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
Until you are more comfortable with the terminal, do not remove (rm) any files or directories from daq3. If you accidentally remove a file or directory, contact Dr. McNulty.
</Callout>

In part 2, we will learn how to connect to a remote server using SSH. We will connect to the daq3 server and run some commands.

### 12. Connect to a Remote Server using SSH

Use SSH to securely connect to a remote server.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
    ssh -Y daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
   ssh -Y daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
``` sh {3} copy
   ssh -Y daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="️ℹ️">
 Get your password from Dr. McNulty.
</Callout>
You will now be prompted to enter your password. Enter your password and press enter. Thats it! You are now connected to the daq3 server. You can use 'ls' and have a look at the file structure. Then go ahead and disconnect from the server by typing `exit` and pressing enter.

### 13. Transfer Files using SCP

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  This is a dangerous command. When you scp files it will automaticly overwrite files with the same name. Only use the files in this tutorial to practice with. Do not try any other files until you are more comfortable with this command.
</Callout>

Use SCP (Secure Copy) to transfer files between your local machine and a remote server. Make sure you have disconnected from the daq3 server before continuing.

#### Copy a File from Your Local Machine to a Remote Server

First create a directory again 'terminal-tutorial ' on your local machine as in part 1 of this tutorial. And create a file named 'example.txt' in that directory.
If have trouble doing this, go back to part 1 of this tutorial.

Now, you will copy the 'example.txt' file from your local machine to the remote server.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp [local_file_path]/terminal-tutorial/example.txt daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp [local_file_path]/terminal-tutorial/example.txt daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp [local_file_path]/terminal-tutorial/example.txt daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Replace [local_file_path] with the actual path of the file on your local machine. you can use the command 'pwd' to get the path of the current directory.
</Callout>

You will be promtped again for your password. Enter your password and press enter.


#### Copy a File from a Remote Server to Your Local Machine

Now, you will copy the 'example.txt' file from the remote server to your local machine.

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq/example.txt [local_file_path]/terminal-tutorial
    ```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```sh {3} copy
    scp daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq/example.txt [local_file_path]/terminal-tutorial
```

 </Tab>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq/example.txt [local_file_path]/terminal-tutorial
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You will be promtped again for your password. Enter your password and press enter.

### 14. Transfer a Directory using SCP

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  This is a dangerous command when you scp directories it will automaticly overwrite directories with the same name. Be very careful when using this command.
  Only use the directories in this tutorial to practice with. Do not try any other directories until you are more comfortable with this command.
</Callout>

Now you will transfer an entire directory from your local machine to the remote server. To transfer a directory and its contents, use the `-r` option.

#### Copy a Directory from Your Local Machine to a Remote Server

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp -r [local_directory_path]/terminal-tutorial daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp -r [local_directory_path]/terminal-tutorial daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp -r [local_directory_path]/terminal-tutorial daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Copy a Directory from a Remote Server to Your Local Machine

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows PowerShell', 'Windows Command Prompt']}>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp -r daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq/terminal-tutorial [local_directory_path]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp -r daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq/terminal-tutorial [local_directory_path]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```    sh {3} copy
    scp -r daq@daq3.physics.isu.edu:/home/daq/terminal-tutorial [local_directory_path]
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

That's it! You now know how to use SSH to connect to a remote server and use SCP to transfer files between your local machine and the remote server. With these skills, you can efficiently manage your files and directories when working with remote systems.
